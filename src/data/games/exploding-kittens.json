  "description": "Exploding Kittens is a highly-strategic, kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette. Players draw cards until someone draws an Exploding Kitten, at which point they explode, they are dead, and they are out of the game â€” unless that player has a Defuse card, which can defuse the Kitten using things like laser pointers, belly rubs, and catnip sandwiches.",

  "basicRules": [
    "To start, remove all the Exploding Kittens (4) and Defuse Cards (6) from the deck.",
    "Shuffle the remaining deck and deal 7 cards to each player.",
    "Each player gets 1 Defuse Card. So each player starts with a total of 8 cards.",
    "Insert the remaining Defuse Cards back into the deck.",
    "Insert enough Exploding Kittens back into the deck so that there is 1 fewer than the number of players. Remove any extra Exploding Kittens from the game.",
    "Shuffle the deck and place it face down in the middle of the table.",
    "Pick a player to go first. Play goes clockwise.",
    "On your turn, you can play as many cards as you like from your hand, or none at all. Then, draw a card from the top of the draw pile to end your turn.",
    "If you draw an Exploding Kitten, you must show it immediately. Unless you have a Defuse card, you're out of the game.",
    "The last player who hasn't exploded wins the game."

    "Try to save your Defuse cards.",
    "Use your other cards to avoid drawing, or to force other players to draw multiple cards.",
    "Keep track of how many Exploding Kittens are left in the deck."
