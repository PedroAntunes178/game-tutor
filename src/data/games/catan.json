    "The board is set up with hexagonal tiles representing different types of terrain. Each tile gets a number token.",
    "Each player starts with two settlements and two roads.",
    "On your turn, you roll two dice. The sum of the dice determines which tiles produce resources. Any player with a settlement or city adjacent to a producing tile gets a resource card of that type.",
    "You can then trade resource cards with other players or with the bank.",
    "You can use your resource cards to build new roads, settlements, or cities, or to buy development cards.",
    "The first player to reach 10 victory points wins the game. Victory points are earned from settlements, cities, the 'longest road', the 'largest army', and certain development cards."
