    "Each player is dealt a number of train car cards and destination tickets. Destination tickets show two cities that the player must try to connect.",
    "On your turn, you can either draw more train car cards, draw more destination tickets, or claim a route on the board.",
    "To claim a route, you must play a set of train car cards that match the color and length of the route.",
    "When you claim a route, you place your colored trains on it and score points based on the length of the route.",
    "The game ends when one player has two or fewer of their colored trains left.",
    "Players then reveal their destination tickets. If they successfully connected the cities on their ticket, they get the points indicated on the ticket. If they failed, they lose those points.",

    "Try to complete your destination tickets, but don't be afraid to draw more if you have a good network of routes.",
    "Longer routes are worth more points, but they are also harder to claim.",
    "Pay attention to what routes other players are claiming, as they might be trying to block you."
