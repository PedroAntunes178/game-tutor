    "If there are 2-3 players, each player is dealt 7 cards. If there are 4-5 players, each player is dealt 5 cards. The rest of the cards are placed face down in a pile. This is the 'fish pond'.",
    "The player to the left of the dealer starts. On your turn, you ask another player for a specific rank of card (e.g., 'Do you have any eights?'). You must have at least one card of the rank you are asking for.",
    "If the player you asked has any cards of that rank, they must give them all to you. You then get another turn.",
    "If the player you asked does not have any cards of that rank, they say 'Go Fish!'. You must then draw a card from the fish pond.",
    "If you draw the card you asked for, you show it to the other players and get another turn. If you draw a different card, your turn ends.",
    "When you collect all four cards of one rank, you show the book to the other players and place it face up in front of you.",
    "The game ends when all 13 books have been made. The player with the most books wins."
