    "On your turn, you draw a land tile and place it adjacent to a tile that is already on the table.",
    "After placing a tile, you can choose to place one of your 'meeples' (followers) on it. You can place a meeple on a city, a road, a cloister, or a field.",
    "When a city, road, or cloister is completed, the meeple on it scores points for its owner and is returned to the player's supply.",
