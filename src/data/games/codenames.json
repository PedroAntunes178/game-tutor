    "Twenty-five codename cards are laid out in a 5x5 grid.",
    "The two spymasters are given a key card that shows them which cards belong to their team, which are neutral, and which one is the assassin.",
    "The spymasters take turns giving one-word clues to their teammates. The clue should relate to one or more of the words on the grid that belong to their team.",
    "The spymaster also gives a number, which tells their teammates how many words on the grid relate to the clue.",
    "The teammates try to guess the correct words. If they guess a word that belongs to their team, they can keep guessing. If they guess a neutral word or a word that belongs to the other team, their turn ends. If they guess the assassin, their team immediately loses.",
    "The first team to guess all of their words wins the game."
