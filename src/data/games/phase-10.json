    "Each player is dealt 10 cards. The rest of the deck is placed face down to form a draw pile. The top card is turned over to start a discard pile.",
    "The player to the left of the dealer goes first. A turn consists of drawing a card, either from the draw pile or the discard pile, and then discarding a card.",
    "The goal is to complete the current 'phase'. The first phase is two sets of three.",
    "Once a player has completed their phase, they can 'hit' on other players who have also completed their phase. This means adding to their existing sets or runs.",
    "The hand ends when one player 'goes out' by getting rid of all of their cards.",
    "Players who completed their phase move on to the next phase. Players who did not must try to complete the same phase again in the next hand.",
    "The first player to complete all ten phases wins the game."
