    "Each player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.",
    "The objective of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in 'check') and there is no way for it to escape.",
    "Each of the six piece types moves differently. The most powerful piece is the queen and the least powerful piece is the pawn.",
    "White moves first, after which players take turns moving one piece at a time.",
    "The game can end in a number of ways besides checkmate: a player can resign, or the game can end in a draw in several ways."
