    "Players are in two partnerships. Partners sit opposite each other.",
    "Five cards are dealt to each player. The top card of the remaining deck is turned up.",
    "Players bid on whether they want to make the turned-up suit trump. If a player thinks they can win at least three tricks with that suit as trump, they can 'order it up'.",
    "If no one orders up the card, there is a second round of bidding where players can name any other suit as trump.",
    "The team that chooses the trump suit is called the 'makers'. The other team is the 'defenders'.",
    "The player to the left of the dealer leads the first trick. Players must follow suit if they can.",
    "The highest card of the suit led wins the trick, unless a trump is played, in which case the highest trump card wins.",
    "The 'right bower' (the jack of the trump suit) is the highest trump. The 'left bower' (the other jack of the same color) is the second-highest trump.",
    "The makers score 1 point if they win 3 or 4 tricks, and 2 points if they win all 5 tricks. If the makers fail to win 3 tricks, they are 'euchred', and the defenders score 2 points.",
    "The first team to score 10 points wins the game."
